Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can greatly improve treatment outcomes and help doctors make better decisions. The goal of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their medical history and demographic information.

Key Features:
Classification Problem: Predict if a patient has heart disease (binary classification: yes/no).
Machine Learning Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.


Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Important for imbalanced datasets.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative values.
ROC-AUC: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
Results
The results of each model are evaluated based on the metrics mentioned above. A summary of the model performance can be found in the evaluation section of the notebook.
